This is a tool that substituting for the simplify curve tool which is a standard function.

The classic simplify is simplifying the arcs terribly, even destroys them.
Therefore I devised the way that left the peak of the f-curve and keep the shape as much as possible.
If there is a key you want to left, select key and add a check to "Lock Selected Key".
In addition, it is equipped with rapid bake function and delete static key function.
In the case of scene reduction, please use it.
